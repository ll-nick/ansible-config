## Prose

Use semantic line breaks (https://sembr.org/) in all prose files (Markdown, LaTeX, Typst).
Break after every sentence,
and also after independent clauses ending in a comma, semicolon, or colon.
Optionally break after dependent clauses,
before lists,
or around links and inline markup.
Never break inside a hyphenated word,
and never in a way that changes the rendered output.

Line length: ~90 characters as a rule of thumb, not a hard limit.
If the project defines a maximum (formatter config, editorconfig, linter), obey that instead.

## Code

Use verbose, descriptive names.
Readability beats brevity — readable code is self-documenting.

Prefer defined types (dataclass, named tuple, struct, TypedDict, enum)
over bare tuples, dicts, or magic strings.
They read better and give the type checker something to work with.

Never install Python packages globally (no `pip install`, not even `--user`).
Use `uvx` for one-off tooling, e.g. `uvx --from Pillow python -c "..."`.

## Comments and documentation

Keep comments and docs sparse.
Document *why*, never *how*: the code already shows how, and prose about it drifts out of date.
A "why" comment is justified when the code deviates from the intuitive or common approach
for a non-obvious reason.

Never document why an alternative approach was *not* taken after changing direction.
Readers who never saw the original approach only find it confusing.

## Linters

Never disable a rule globally unless it is absolutely justified.
In order of preference:

1. Fix the issue the way the linter wants.
2. Line-level ignore for a justified one-off.
3. File-level ignore when the violation is localized to that file
   (e.g. a test importing a module's private members).
4. Project-level disable only when the rule is inherently meaningless for the use case.
