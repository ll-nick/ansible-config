# üõ†Ô∏è Personal Ansible Configuration

This repository contains my personal Ansible setup used to configure and manage my systems consistently and efficiently.

## üöÄ Usage

I'm not sure why you would want to use my config but don't let that stop you!

Clone and apply the configuration using `ansible-pull`:

```bash
ansible-pull -U https://github.com/ll-nick/ansible-config.git
```

To also deploy tasks that require root privileges, use:

```bash
ansible-pull -U https://github.com/ll-nick/ansible-config.git --tags all,privileged --ask-become-pass
```

For first time usage, there is also a [bash script](deploy/deploy.sh) that can be used
 to interactively install the required dependencies (including ansible itself), then execute the playbook.

During deployment, the `update-config` and `update-config-privileged` aliases are installed to update the configuration in the future.
