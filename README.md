# üõ†Ô∏è Personal Ansible Configuration

This repository contains my personal Ansible setup used to configure and manage my systems consistently and efficiently.

## üì¶ Contents

The playbook is meant to be run on localhost via `ansible-pull`.  
It is designed to install as many tools as possible on the user level and

---
A very limited amount of tasks require root privileges for system-wide installation of basic dependencies which can be deployed using the `privileged` tag, see below.
Running the playbook without these privileges expects those packages to be installed already.

The config is tested on
- Arch Linux
- NixOS[^1]
- Ubuntu 24.04

[^1]: kitty and tmux need to be installed via nixpkgs.

## üöÄ Usage

I'm not sure why you would want to use my config but don't let that stop you!

Clone and apply the configuration using `ansible-pull`:

```bash
ansible-pull -U https://github.com/ll-nick/ansible-config.git
```

To also deploy tasks that require root privileges, use:

```bash
ansible-pull -U https://github.com/ll-nick/ansible-config.git --tags all,privileged --ask-become-pass
```

For first time usage, there is also a [bash script](deploy/deploy.sh) that can be used
 to interactively install the required dependencies (including ansible itself), then execute the playbook.

The ansible playbook mostly only installs packages initially, then installs the `update-all` script to `~/.local/bin/` which handles updating everything in one go.
All tasks are idempotent though, so running the playbook again will not cause any harm.
